# Sun-Earth-Moon Simulation

This project is a simple JavaScript animation that visualizes the Sun, Earth, and Moon system. The animation features:
- The Sun at the center of the screen.
- The Earth orbiting the Sun.
- The Moon orbiting the Earth.

The animation is responsive, full-screen, and automatically adjusts its size when the browser window is resized.

## Features
- **Sun**: Fixed at the center of the screen.
- **Earth**: Orbits the Sun with a smooth circular motion.
- **Moon**: Orbits the Earth dynamically as the Earth moves around the Sun.

## Live Demo
Open the HTML file in any modern browser to see the simulation in action.

## How to Use
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `solar.html` file in any browser.
3. Resize the browser window to see the full-screen animation adapt dynamically.

## Customizations
- **Change Speeds**: Modify the `speed` values in the JavaScript code to adjust the rotation speeds of Earth and the Moon.
- **Change Sizes or Distances**:
  - Adjust `earth.radius`, `moon.radius` for size.
  - Adjust `earth.distance`, `moon.distance` for orbital distance.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For creating the base structure.
- **CSS**: For styling and ensuring a responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For drawing the Sun, Earth, and Moon, and handling the animation.
